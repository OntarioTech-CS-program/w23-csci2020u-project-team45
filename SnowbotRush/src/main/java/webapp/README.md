## Description
In this final course assignment, our group created a game "SnowbotRush". The objective of the game is for multiple
players to compete with each other if they are playing at the same difficulty level. Once the game is started,
a game board appears on which various "good" assets such as coins, diamonds, snowflakes or jewels will appear.
The squares on the board game are hidden until clicked and the player may unveil the "good assets"
to collect points or lives. "Bad" assets are also present within the game such as icicles which freeze the game,
or a monster [CONFIRM IF TEXTUAL GAMEPLAY IS FINE] which causes the player to lose lives.


Essentially this is a game of chance and competition due to the multi-player component. You may also communicate
with players using the in-game chat functionality.
