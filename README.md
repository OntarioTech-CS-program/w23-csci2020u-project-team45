## Description
In this final course assignment, our group created a game "SnowbotRush". The objective of the game is for two players 
to compete with each other if they are playing at the same difficulty level. Once the game is started,
a game board appears on both the players screen individually. Both the game boards will have various "good" 
assets such as coins, diamonds, snowflakes or jewels. The game boards will also have various "bad" such as icicles 
or a water monster which causes the game to freeze or lose lives respectively. These assets have to be unveiled by clicking 
the "question marks" The robot character reflects these changes through its appearance. For instance when a player 
unveils the icicle, the robot character will have a frozen appearance. 

Essentially this is a game of chance as you will not know what is behind the qustion mark squares until it is clicked.
You are also competing with another player, who has the same selection of question mark boxes to unveil.

Players may also use with the in-game chat functionality.
